### Phase 0
I firmly believe that purchasing a test and picking a test date **before you start** will give you the motivation to meet your deadline. For me, it was 1 week from the day I bought it. Worst case, you can always extend, but this helps beat procrastination and helps justify the hours you're spending to others.
Similarly, it's been proven that people who start with a Pre-test do better and learn better in preparation for an actual test. So, please take the [Scrum Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) and get yourself acquainted with the questions you'll be asked.

### Phase 1
Read [[2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf]] and take some serious notes - As an example, you can check out my notes here: [[Scrum Guide Notes]]. The first passthrough, don't worry about organization, just record as much information as you think is important. After that, you can start refining your definitions until you have perfectly synthesized definitions of every topic.
After each time reading the guide, go to the [Scrum Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open). At the end,[[Don't look at answers for practice tests]]!!! Instead, record your score and use it as a tool to monitor your progress. Once you hit over 95% on the test, congratulate yourself - this means you know the Scrum Guide very well. Now you can move on to Phase 2:

### Phase 2
This is where you really start to expand beyond the Scrum Guide. Start by studying the [Scrum Glossary](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary). This page contains testable definitions that aren't covered in the Scrum Guide. Go over the definitions and make sure you understand each of them. As an example, these are my notes on the [[Scrum Glossary]].
If you have any lingering questions about the relationships between any of the roles, events, or artifacts, I found[[TheSimpleGuideToScrum-1Pager.pdf]] to be very helpful. In a quick glance, you can answer most basic questions about the scrum process.
After you have a basic understanding of these new terms, move on to the  [Scrum Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) and the [Product Owner Open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open). By this point, you should be able to easily pass both, but many of these questions will be on the actual test. In this phase, you should take the time to review your answers and memorize each of the questions and answers. Try to think about what the question is actually asking you, and try to find where the information is found in the Scrum Guide.
Do the same process for the [MLapshin Open Assessment](http://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/](http://mlapshin.com/index.php/psm-quiz/). Take it in Learning Mode. **WARNING**: some of the questions are outdated, so after each question, try to find the answer in the Scrum guide. This will help you hammer in your knowledge of Scrum even more. If you're having a lot of trouble, check out the video that covers [[Scrum Guide Notes#Changes in 2020 Scrum Guide| Changes in 2020 Scrum Guide]].
Take [PSM 1 Practice Test](https://www.thescrummaster.co.uk/assessments/professional-scrum-master-i-psm-i-practice-assessment/) and [[Don't look at answers for practice tests]]. This will be your new metric for how well you are progressing. It is about as difficult as the actual PSM exam, so it will give you a better gauge than the Scrum Open. Also, it is up-to-date with the 2020 Scrum Guide, so you will be able to trust the score that you get. When you finish, record your score, and keep reviewing the other tests until you're confident in the material.
Finally, you'll be ready for phase 3:

### Phase 3
You're approaching test day - your last goal is to cram as much information as possible. Start studying all the test questions from all the exams. If you're consistently missing topics, review the answers and try to study those topics specifically. 
Don't just memorize an answer - think about why the answer is the best fit. What principles outlined in the Scrum Guide make it the best? Here were some of my [[Lessons from Scrum Practice Tests]]. Try to smooth out all the concepts that are giving you trouble, and learn to think like a Scrum Master.
Finally, get comfortable. Turn your phone off, eliminate all distractions, load your notes onto a second monitor (if you have one), and pray.

### Tips
[[Don't look at answers for practice tests]]
- I wish I would have known this one earlier. The moment you look at the answers for a practice test, it becomes worthless.
- Don't look at the answers until you've started using the next test that I've recommended.

Don't take practice test with notes
- Try to see how much you actually understand. You will have notes on the 

Have all your resources laid out
- Start your exam with everything easily accessible
- If you have multiple monitors, even better.
