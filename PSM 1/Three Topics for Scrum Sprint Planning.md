Three topics for Scrum Sprint Planning:
1. **Why is this Sprint valuable?**  Product owner explains potential value before the entire team defines a Sprint Goal that brings value to stakeholders. 
2. **What can be done this Sprint?** Developers work with Product Owner to select and refine an appropriate number of items from Product Backlog based on past performance / capability. 
3. **How will the chosen work get done?** Only the developers define how to create increment based on the chosen goals.
