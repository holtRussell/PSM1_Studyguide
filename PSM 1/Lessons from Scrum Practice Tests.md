# Scrum PreTest
Starting Point:
I got a 70% Scrum Open: [[Scrum Guide Notes#Scrum PreTest]]

Here's what I learned: 
[[Practice Test Lessons Learned]] ^faa29a
 - Pay attention to the roles - not as intutive as you might think
 - Time boxes are testable, but kinda common sense
 - Review below questions for specifics

## Test Review
Which of the following services is appropriate for a Scrum Master in regard to the Daily Scrum?
"The Scrum Master ensures that the Developers have the event, but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Developers to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute timebox. The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only members participate in the Daily Scrum."

Which statement best describes a Product Owner's responsibility?
"The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Scrum Team."

Which statement best describes the Sprint Review?
"Every event in Scrum, besides the Sprint, which is a container for the other events, is an opportunity to Inspect and Adapt." - Not a demo

Who is responsible for managing the progress of work during a Sprint?
"The Developers"

Definition of Scrum:
"Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems."

Three Pillars
- Inspection
- Transparency
- Adaptation

When does sprint concluded?
- When Retro is complete
"The Sprint is a container for the following timeboxed events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. Sprints are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency, and a new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.  
  
The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint, and is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter  
  
Though not typical, a Sprint can end if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to end the Sprint prematurely."

Timeboxes:
 - 15 mins daily
 - 8 hours monthly sprint planning
 - 4 hours monthly Sprint review

When multiple Scrum Teams work together on the same product, each team should maintain a separate Product Backlog.
 - False
"Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many Scrum Teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Developers to determine what they should work on."

When does a Developer become accountable for the value of a Product Backlog item selected for the Sprint?
 - Never. They are always accountable for every item selected
	 - I thought about pulling a specific ticket, not about pulling from backlog

## Next Pretest:

Which of the following services is appropriate for a Scrum Master in regard to the Daily Scrum?
Teach Developers to keep 15 min timebox.

What is the main reason for the Scrum Master to be at the Daily Scrum?
They don't need to - as long as devs are holding it.

Which statement best describes the Sprint Review?
Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect the outcome of a Sprint and figure out what to do next.

It is mandatory that the product Increment be released to production at the end of each Sprint.
False.

**What are two ways a Scrum Master serves to enable effective Scrum Teams?**
Removing Impediments + facilitating Developer decision-making.

Which of the following are examples of a Scrum Team practicing Scrum poorly or not exhibiting traits of a self-managing Scrum Team?
- The Developers are working within the boundaries of their organizations functional description and nicely handing off work from analyst to developer to tester to integration.
- **The Developers invite external stakeholders to the Sprint Planning to ask them how to turn a Product Backlog item into an Increment via a complete and detailed Sprint Backlog.**
- Stakeholders attend the Daily Scrum to check on the Scrum Team’s progress.

## Answers from ML Quiz
What are the three main qualities the team model in Scrum is designed to optimize?
Productivity, Flexibility, Creativity

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
- Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible;
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
- Understanding and practicing agility; and,
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

How does Definition of “Done” help the Scrum Team? Select three most applicable items.
- DoD is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
- DoD guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning
- DoD ensures artifact transparency

Who is responsible for tracking the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal?
- The Development Team

Who is responsible for coping with incomplete artifact transparency?
- The Scrum master - Encourages transparency within the org
From these videos, I found out about the:

It is a good practice to have from time to time a special technical Sprint that consists only of tasks removing the technical debt without implementing any new functionality.
- It is prohibited. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of “Done.”

What part of the capacity of the Development Team does Product Backlog refinement usually consume?
- Product Backlog refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.

All the Scrum Teams working on the same product should have the same Sprint length.
- False. Scrum does not require having aligned Sprints for multiple teams.
**Lesson: If it isn't specified, it isn't required.**
Roles, Rules, Artifacts, events
The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage. The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.

Burn down chart:  shows progress vs deadline. You're either on track, or off track.

The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints
**Question:** Is the increment inclusive of all past increments? Or does it stand on its own?

NO SPEICIFIC ORDER TO BACKLOG - Based on Product Owner's preference.

PROVIDE VALUE FROM FIRST SPRINT.

Sprint Review -> Revised Product Backlog

Doesn't specify that 1 person can only have one role. Just not suggested.

By the end of Retro, scrum team WILL have ID'd improvements
