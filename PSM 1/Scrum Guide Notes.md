# Scrum Guide
Here are all my synthesized notes from the [[2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf]]

## Purpose of Scrum Guide
"Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless"

## Scrum Definition
"Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate **value through adaptive solutions for complex problems**."

in a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where: 
1. A [[Product Owner]] orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog. 
2. The [[#Scrum Team ]]turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint. 
3. The [[#Scrum Team]] and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint. 
4. Repeat

Scrum is purposefully Incomplete: **Not meant to be rigid.**

## Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on [[Empiricism]] and [[Lean Thinking]] to create a **predictable process** in which Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation can improve the team.

### Transparency
Decisions are documented in Artifacts and shared internally and to stakeholders In order to mitigate risk. They are continually inspected by the team.

### Inspection
All [[#Scrum Events]] are opportunities to inspect decisions + requirements in order to prevent miscommunications and spot problems.

### Adaptation
If anything is found to be unacceptable through Inspection, the Team must make adjustments. In order to do this, team must be empowered + motivated to change.

"Difficult when people are not empowered / self-managing."

## Scrum Values
Scrum reinforces these values: #todo 
1. **Commitment** to achieving goals + supporting each other
2. **Focus** on on making the best progress possible
3. **Openness** about work + challenges
4. **Respect** each other to be capable, independent people...
5. **Courage** to do the right thing

These play hand in hand with 3 pillars

## Scrum Team
There are **no ranks** in a Scrum team, just 3 roles working together to create a team that is fully responsible and capable for their tasks. [[The Optimal Size for a Scrum Team]] allows them to make progress while being nimble.

**Cross Functional:** the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. and are responsible for all of it.
**Self Managing:** they internally decide who does what, when, and how.



### Developers
[[Scrum Developers]] are responsible for daily progress on the tasks defined in the [[Sprint Backlog]], completing tasks according to their [[Definition of Done]]. They should have all the skills to complete the [[Sprint]] and should hold each other accountable.

### Product Owner
The [[Scrum Product Owner]] is a **single person** who is ultimately responsible for maximizing the quality of the team's output by turning Stakeholder requirements into [[Scrum Effective Product Backlog Management]] items. The team is expected to follow the decisions of the product owner.

### Scrum Master
The [[Scrum Master]] is a Servant leader who is ultimately accountable for the team's effectiveness . There are [[Many ways that Scrum masters serve the team]], but they all center around taking care of people, removing blockers, and helping them understand the benefits of Scrum

## Scrum Events
All events exist within the Sprint and are an opportunity to inspect + adapt the artifacts. For best results, they should be held at the same time and should follow the Scrum Guide's descriptions.

### Sprint
Ideas become value in this self-repeating monthly event, centered around a Sprint Goal, that contains all other events. [[Problems with a Scrum Sprint longer than 1 month | They should last no more than a month]], should be based on [[Empiricism instead of Forecasting Progress]], and should follow the [[expectations during a sprint]].

### Sprint Planning
In 8 hours or less, **the entire team** creates the [[Sprint Backlog]] by covering the [[Three Topics for Scrum Sprint Planning]]. Product owners ensure that attendees are prepared to talk about [[Product Backlog]] item's significance.

### Daily Scrum
The [[Daily Scrum]] is a 15 min daily event for [[Scrum Developers]] to track progress of Sprint, adjust Backlog (if necessary), and create a course of action for the next day's efforts. While Daily Scrum covers everything, developers can meet at other times for more detailed discussion of Sprint's Backlog, and other members can attend as developers.


### Sprint Review
The [[Sprint Review]] is more than just a presentation, it's up to a **4 hour** "working session" where the [[#Scrum Team]] presents work to shareholders, reflects on the sprint accomplishments, and can adapt the Product Backlog based on the new environment. 

### Sprint Retrospective
In this **3 hour** conclusion to the [[#Sprint]], the **Scrum Team** explores the assumptions and solutions made around the [[Topics of a Sprint Retrospective]] in order to boost future performance / quality and identify next best steps.

## Scrum Artifacts
Artifacts boost transparency by documenting all work + value provided within a sprint. Each artifact has a commitment that provides a snapshot around when that decision was made.

### Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is the single source that [[Scrum Developers]] will select tasks from to improve the product in a [[#Sprint]]. Based on the [[Product Goal]], tasks can be created, refined, and adjusted by the [[Scrum Product Owner]].

"A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract"
#### Commitment: Product Goal
Product goal is a **single**, long-term, target for the Scrum Team's product. It is held in the Product Backlog what all other backlog Items are built from.

### Sprint Backlog
The [[Sprint Backlog]] should be specific enough for [[Developers]] to inspect each others work. Developers are the sole owners and can work with the [[Product Owner]] to adjust as long as it doesn't impact Sprint Goal.

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal
This **single objective** is created by the [[#Scrum Team]] during [[#Sprint Planning]] to unify the [[#Scrum Team]] during the sprint. It allows flexibility in how the [[Developers]] accomplish tasks, but provides clear expectations for the end result.

### Increment
Each progressive, usable step towards the Product Goal is presented on (or before) the [[Sprint Review]]. It doesn't count unless it meets the [[Definition of Done]], can have other increments within the same Sprint, and should work together with all other Increments towards a [[Product Goal]].

#### Commitment: Definition of Done
The moment the [[Scrum Developers]] have worked on a [[Product Backlog]] item enough to meet this description, it becomes a [[Scrum Increment]]. If the organization has outlined standards, those will act as a minimum expectation, otherwise the Scrum Team creates standards.

DoD is a Single standard for one (or more) Scrum teams that provides a shared understanding of the requirements of the Sprint Backlog Item. If the standard is not met, item can not be presented or released to stakeholders.

# Changes in 2020 Scrum Guide
Check out this video if you're struggling to spot outdated answers: [Top Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCGY4QiXlh0&ab_channel=SrcCodes)
- Developers vs Development Team
- Self-managing instead of 
- True leader
- No more 3 questions

# Must vs Should vs often vs suggested vs can
I went back through to find some of the explicit commands versus the suggestions:

"Scrum artifacts must be inspected frequently and diligently"
"If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced **must** be adjusted"


"If scrum teams become too big, they **Should** consider reorganizing"
"They (broken up teams) **Should share** the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner."

"For Product owners to succeed, the entire organization MUST respect their decisions."

"Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place"

"Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making"

"Sprint COULD be canceled if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete"

"The sprint goal **Must** be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning"

Daily Scrum: "Developers can select whatever structure they want"

Sprint Review: "Proudct Backlog **May** be adjusted"

Retro: "They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint."

Backlog "They **Usually** acquire this degree of tranparency ("Ready for Work") after refinement."

"They **Must** fulfill or abandon one objective before taking on the next."

Sprint Backlog "It **Should** have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum."

"In order to provide value, the Increment **Must** be usable."

"If the DoD is part of the standards, all Scrum Teams **Must** follow it as a minimum"
