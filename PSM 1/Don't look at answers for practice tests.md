# Don't look at answers for practice tests
The moment you look at the answer bank for a question, it loses all value. It's better to use practice tests as a way to measure progress - slowly improving your score over time rather than inspecting questions and learning how to take the test better. (Unless Test Dumping, which is MEGA lame)

Example: I took the Scrum Open, learned the answers, and then never struggled with it again because I already knew the answers. If I hadn't read the answers, I could have continued to use it as a way to gauge my understanding of the concepts.
