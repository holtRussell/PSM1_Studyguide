# Scrum Glossary:
There's a few extra definitions you should familiarize yourself with before the test. They're all found in the [Scrum Glossary](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary).

Here are my personal notes:
## Burn Down Charts
- amount of work remaining in Sprint
- time x work
- decreases as remaining work is removed
- could be measured many ways
	- User Story Points
	- Task Hours
- shows work remaining in backlogs

## Burn Up Charts
- amount of work completed
- time x work
- upward slope
- story Points or task hours
- Burn-up approaches total expected work

## Coherence
if backlog items are related, it may be worth considering them as a "Package Deal"

## Emergence
realizing facts over time (through actions) - see: [[Empiricism]]

## Engineering Standards
standards for Devs to create Increments.

## Forecast (of Functionality)
items Developers think seem they can handle during Sprint

## Scrum Board
(optional) physical board to show Sprint Backlog + Progress made.

## Self Managing
The team decides who does what, when, and how.

## Stakeholder
- External
- required interest / knowledge in product
- Represented by PO
- Included in Retro

## Technical Debt
- (unpredictable) cost of maintaining a product
- bad design decisions
- contributes to ???total cost of ownership???
- May be accidental or intentional for faster solution

## Total Cost of Ownership
Total cost of a product during it's lifecycle. From creation to death.

## Values: 
- The values feed into the pillars of Scrum
- values are shown in every part of Scrum (events, roles, artifacts)

## Velocity
- record of PB items turned into Increment during Sprint by Scrum Team.
- Tracked by Developers

[[#Sprint]]

## Other Definitions
You should already know these definitions:

[[#Daily Scrum]]
[[Definition of Done]] **Created by team IF no Org Standards** - Guidelines for acceptable increment on Product Backlog Items. 
[[#Developer]] - anyone who provides value on increment - SOle owner of [[#Sprint Backlog]] items and only member required at [[#Daily Scrum]]
[[#Incerment]] - Stepping Stone towards Product Goal - inclueds all "done" Product Backlog items. Provides transparency to progress made in sprint. Devs only.
[[#Product Backlog]]single source of all items around Product Goal - Managed by Product Owner - "Create, maintain, and sustain a product"
[[2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf]] - "accountabilities, events, artifacts, and rules"
[[Scrum Master]] - helping org understand + implement Scrum.
[[#Scrum Team]] - 10 or less - Developers, scrum Master, Product Owner. Self-directed Cross-competent - all responsible for creating value during sprint. DoD, 
[[#Scrum Values]] - Commitment Focus Openness Courage Respect
